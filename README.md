## Compatibility With Other Extensions

It is possible to combine this extension with other cursor movement extensions.

You can use the `inRegionMode` context flag in the `when` clause of your keybind
to provide different behaviour for region mode vs. cursor mode. The default
keybinds are laid out as follows:

```json
{
    "key": "DESIRED KEY",
    "command": "CURSOR MOVE COMMAND",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && !inRegionMode"
},
{
    "key": "DESIRED KEY",
    "command": "CURSOR MOVE & SELECT COMMAND",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && inRegionMode"
}
```

## Known Issues

- When cutting text (`emacs.action.clipboardCutAction`), sometimes only the line
  the cursor is on is removed, but the full region is sent to the clipboard. Not
  sure what the cause is - perhaps this is related to
  [vscode#2933](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/2933).
